Authentication Context
- Use localStorage for fast hydration of auth state on page load.
- Implement session token caching to prevent loading UI flicker.
- Add proper tab synchronization for auth state across browser tabs.
- Use debouncing for auth state updates to prevent UI jank.
- Track hydration state separately from loading state.

File Upload Handling
- Use XMLHttpRequest with progress event tracking for uploads.
- Implement proper error handling for upload failures.
- Provide meaningful progress indicators for long-running uploads.
- Cache uploaded file information where appropriate.
- Use Supabase Storage with signed URLs for secure uploads.

Error Handling
- Implement consistent error logging.
- Create reusable error boundaries for component failures.
- Use toast notifications for user-facing errors.
- Provide graceful fallbacks for failed network requests.
- Implement retry logic for transient failures.

Testing
- Write unit tests for critical utility functions.
- Create integration tests for auth flows.
- Test loading, error, and success states for components.
- Mock Supabase responses for consistent test results.
- Test UI components in isolation with well-defined props.
