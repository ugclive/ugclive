Viral AI UGC is an AI UGC content tool for TikTok. Frontend and DB are completely vibe-coded with Lovable.
 The tech stack includes Vite (React) for the frontend, Supabase for the database, Vercel for hosting, and a Node.js server that runs locally to render videos at no cost. You can use everything on the free tier of each service. T
he entire project was built in just 48 hours spread across one week. Feel free to use it, and don't hesitate to [reach out](https://x.com/rushabtated4) if you encounter any issues.

## Overview

This documentation provides step-by-step instructions for self-hosting the Viral AI UGC platform. The setup process consists of four main components:

1. Supabase (Database)
2. Vercel (Frontend)
3. Backend Server
4. Google Cloud Console (Authentication)

Total estimated setup time: 30 minutes

## Step 1: Supabase Setup

1. **Create a new Supabase project**
    - Navigate to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
    - Sign in or create an account
    - If this is your first time using Supabase, you'll be prompted to create an organization
    - Click "New Project"
2. **Configure your project**
    - Enter a name for your project
    - Create a strong database password and store it securely
    - Select the region closest to your target audience for optimal performance
    - Click "Create Project"
3. **Initialize database schema**
    - In the left navigation panel, click "SQL Editor"
    - Paste the SQL schema provided
    
    ```tsx
    -- Enum Types
    create type plan as enum ('free', 'pro', 'ultra');
    create type template_type as enum ('aiavatar', 'game', 'usergenerated');
    create type text_alignment as enum ('top', 'center', 'bottom');

    ```
    
    - Click "Run" to execute the query and set up your database tables, storage and RLS policies
4. **Retrieve API credentials**
    - Navigate to the "Home" tab in the Supabase dashboard or “Data API” from the project settings
    - Copy your Supabase URL, Anon Key and Service Role Key (you'll need these for subsequent steps)
    - Copy Callback URL from Authentication > Singin/up >Google (you'll need these for subsequent steps)
5. **Import sample data**
    - Navigate to the "Table Editor" in the left panel
    - Select the "sounds" table
    - Click "Import" and upload the provided [CSV file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VYaiKbKesFjsk4cDs9kM7A5cp2LSRpb6/view?usp=sharing) containing sample sounds
    - Repeat the process for the "templates" table using the [templates CSV file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xpugIgsV5pD0fj7XesAoJE1ufKndudeB/view?usp=sharing)

> Note: The imported data connects to pre-configured storage for testing purposes. For production, you'll need to upload your own sounds and templates to your Supabase storage.
You can configure all the assets by uploading them in Storage “sound” and “templates” respectively and create entries or just upload from frontend

## Step 2: Vercel Frontend Deployment

1. **Fork the repository**
    - Navigate to the project's GitHub repository
    - Click "Fork" in the upper right corner
    - Copy the URL of your forked repository
2. **Deploy to Vercel**
    - Sign in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
    - Click "Create a new Project"
    - Connect your GitHub account if not already connected
    - Import the forked repository
    - Select the "Frontend" directory from the "Root Directory" dropdown
3. **Configure environment variables**
    - In the Vercel deployment settings, add the following environment variables:
    
    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<https://your-supabase-url>
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
    
    ```
    
    - Replace the placeholders with your actual Supabase credentials
4. **Deploy the frontend**
    - Click "Deploy"
    - Wait for the deployment to complete
    - Once deployed, Vercel will provide you with a preview URL
    - Preview the app and see it in action!

## Step 3: Backend Server Configuration

You need to set up the backend to render videos (the server must be running whenever you want to generate videos). Carousels can be created without the server running. The server uses Remotion to render videos and connects to your database to save the generated videos in the appropriate storage location.

1. **Clone the repository locally**
    - Open your terminal
    - Run `git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-forked-repo.git](https://github.com/rish9600/viralaiugc)`
    - Navigate to the cloned directory
2. **Configure environment variables**
    - Locate the `.env.example` file in the root directory
    - change the name to `.env` file
    - Update it with your Supabase credentials (you can find them in Project settings > Data API):
    
    ```
    # App
    PORT=3000
    RENDER_CONCURRENCY=5
    
    # Supabase
    SUPABASE_URL=<https://your-supabase-url>
    SUPABASE_KEY=<your-supabase-service-key>
    SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=generated-videos
    
    ```
    
3. **Install FFmpeg**
    - FFmpeg is required for video codec detection and processing
    - Installation instructions vary by operating system:
        - **macOS**: `brew install ffmpeg`
        - **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
        - **Windows**: Download from [FFmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
    - Installation may take 5-10 minutes
4. **Install dependencies and start the server**
    - run command  `cd backend` to go inside the backend folder
    - Run `npm install` to install all required packages in the backend folder
    - Once complete, run `npm start` to launch the backend server
    - The server should now be running on port 3000 (or as specified in your `.env` file)

## Step 4: Authentication Setup

1. **Create a Google Cloud project**
    - Navigate to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
    - Click "Create Project" and enter a project name
    - Click "Create"
2. **Configure OAuth consent screen**
    - In the left navigation panel, go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
    - Select "External" user type
    - Enter your application name and other required information
    - Save and continue
3. **Configure OAuth credentials**
    - In the left navigation panel, go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
    - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
    - Select "Web application" as the application type
    - Enter a name for your OAuth client
4. **Set up redirect URIs**
    - In Supabase, navigate to "Authentication" > "Providers"
    - Enable Google Auth
    - Copy the OAuth redirect URI provided by Supabase
    - Return to Google Cloud Console and add this URI to the "Authorized redirect URIs" field
    - Click "Create"
5. **Complete Google Auth setup in Supabase**
    - Google will provide you with a Client ID and Client Secret
    - In Supabase, paste these credentials into the Google Auth configuration
    - Save the configuration
6. **Update URL configuration**
    - In Supabase, navigate to "Authentication" > "URL Configuration"
    - Add your Vercel preview URL to both the Site URL and Redirect URLs sections

## Step 5: Using the Application

1. **Start using the app**
    - Your server and web app should be running fine at this point
    - Go to your Vercel preview URL
    - Sign up using the authentication you configured
    - Start generating videos and carousels
2. **Important note about video generation**
    - The local server must be active to generate and save videos
    - Carousels can be created without the server running
    - The server uses Remotion to render videos and connects to your database
3. **Before generating videos**
    - Open your IDE and project
    - Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
    - Start the server using `npm start`
    - Keep the server running throughout your video generation session

> Note: You'll need to start the server each time you want to generate videos. The server does not need to be running for other application features like for generating carousels.
> 

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during setup:

- **Database connection errors**: Verify your Supabase URL and Anon Key are correctly entered in all configuration files
- **FFmpeg installation issues**: Consult the [FFmpeg documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html) for platform-specific installation guidance
- **Backend server not starting**: Check for error messages in the terminal and ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
- **Authentication errors**: Verify that your Google OAuth credentials are correctly configured in both Google Cloud Console and Supabase
